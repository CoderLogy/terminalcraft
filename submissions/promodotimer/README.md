Here's an updated version of the GitHub README that includes the required libraries for your `terminal-app.py` and explains the setup accordingly:

# Terminal App

A simple terminal-based Python application built with `pygame`, `textual`, and other Python libraries. This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the `terminal-app.py` file on your local machine.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.6** or higher installed on your system.
- **pip** (Python package manager) to install dependencies.

### Libraries Used

This project uses the following libraries:

- `time` (Standard Python Library)
- `threading` (Standard Python Library)
- `subprocess` (Standard Python Library)
- `sys` (Standard Python Library)
- `os` (Standard Python Library)
- `pygame` (For handling multimedia and graphical output)
- `datetime` (Standard Python Library)
- `textual` (For building terminal applications with rich UI)
- `rich` (For styling and formatting terminal output)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terminal-app.git
cd terminal-app
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)

To keep dependencies isolated, it's a good idea to set up a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you can manually install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pygame textual rich
```

This will install the necessary libraries, including `pygame`, `textual`, and `rich`.

## Running the Application

Once everything is set up, you can run the `terminal-app.py` script from the terminal:

```bash
python terminal-app.py
```

### Example

If your script requires any command-line arguments or configurations, you can run the app with the desired parameters. For example:

```bash
python terminal-app.py --option value
```

Check the code or documentation to see what arguments or configurations the app supports.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with missing dependencies, try running `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.
- Ensure that you're using the correct version of Python by running `python --version`.
- If there are errors related to `pygame`, make sure you have the proper dependencies installed for your system (e.g., SDL or other graphics libraries for `pygame`).
